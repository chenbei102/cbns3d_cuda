This repository provides a **High-Order GPU-Accelerated 3D Compressible Navier-Stokes Solver**. The solver employs high-order finite difference methods to solve the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations on curvilinear structured meshes. Developed in C++ with CUDA, it leverages GPU acceleration to significantly enhance computational efficiency. 

This code is derived from my research experience in numerical methods for CFD, and it emphasizes clarity and maintainability, prioritizing transparent algorithmic logic over micro-level code optimization.
